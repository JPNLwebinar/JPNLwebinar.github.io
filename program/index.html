                Plant metabolites have a significant impact on microbial communities. They take part in the recruitment and selection of microbes from the soil microbial pool but also manipulate their activities. The secretion of plant metabolites does not follow a simple continuum, but it is rather dynamic, changing in quantities and qualities depending on plants' needs. It is well known that biotic and abiotic stresses can cause drastic changes in exudates. Moreover, plant development and even circadian rhythms have significant effects on exudate profiles. Plant domestication and selective breeding have resulted in genetic bottleneck events in these plants but to what extent these events affect root exudation and consequently, microbiome composition is less clear. I will discuss my current project in which I am investigating the following questions: 1) how domestication affects plant exudates, 2) and if these metabolites are directly involved in microbial recruitment.

                Isoflavones function as signals for soybean-rhizobia symbiosis and in shaping microbial assemblages in the soybean rhizosphere. Despite these functions in the rhizosphere, isoflavone secretion mechanisms are still to be characterized at the molecular level. It has been revealed that the amount and components of isoflavone in root exudates change throughout the developmental stages, but their diurnal variations remain unknown. We investigated the diurnal metabolic regulation of isoflavones in hydroponically grown soybean by RNA-seq and LC-MS. GmMYB176, a transcription factor gene for isoflavone biosynthesis, was upregulated from 6 a.m. to 12 a.m. in roots. Gene expression levels of isoflavone biosynthetic genes were high at noon and low at night. Besides, the contents of isoflavone aglycones in roots showed a diurnal change following the biosynthetic gene expression. These results suggest the diurnal cycle of isoflavone biosynthesis in soybean roots. The content of isoflavone aglycones in root exudates had no significant variation throughout the day. The expression level of ICHG (isoflavone conjugate-hydrolyzing Î²-glucosidase) was high during the night, suggesting a regulatory mechanism to keep isoflavone aglycone secretion at a consistent level. We also found several isoflavone transporter candidate genes which exhibited high correlations with isoflavone biosynthetic genes by diurnal co-expression analysis.
